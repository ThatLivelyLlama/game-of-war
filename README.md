The game of war starts when two players have entered their name
A fresh deck of cards is created, shuffled and split into two stacks of 26. One for each player
The game will automaticially run through each round having each player flip over their top card. 
The person witht he highest card (Aces high) wins the round.
However, if the scores of the two cards match. Then WAR!
In war players place down 3 extra cards and on the fourth they battle it out. The cycle continues until someone comes out on top.
The game is won, once one player holds all the cards, or you are unable to draw enough cards to continue in a WAR!
